The solution involves correctly configuring the `purge` option within `tailwind.config.js`. Instead of using an overly restrictive approach to purging unused CSS (which may inadvertently remove your actual classes), modify the `content` array to include all relevant files. For example, if your Vue/React components reside in the `src/components` directory, you should include it like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  purge: [
    './src/**/*.html',
    './src/**/*.js',
    './src/**/*.jsx',
    './src/**/*.vue',
    './src/**/*.ts',
    './src/**/*.tsx',
  ],
  // ...rest of your tailwind config
}
```
This ensures that Tailwind CSS analyzes your application's code and includes only the necessary classes, preventing the removal of classes needed for your component styling. Make sure that file extensions include all component types used in your project (e.g., `.js`, `.jsx`, `.vue`, `.ts`, `.tsx`). If you are using a build process, you may need to adjust paths to reflect your project's structure.
