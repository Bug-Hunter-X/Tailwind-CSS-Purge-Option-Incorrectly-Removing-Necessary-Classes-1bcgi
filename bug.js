This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Vue.js or React.js.  The issue arises when attempting to style a component using Tailwind classes, but the styles do not appear to be applied correctly.  This often happens when the `purge` option in the `tailwind.config.js` is not configured correctly, leading to unused CSS classes being removed, removing the necessary classes for your component.
